Graphical User Interface (GUI) for Graphical User Interface (GUI) for compressive strength prediction of Glass powder concrete using XGB

This Graphical User Interface for Graphical User Interface (GUI) for Graphical User Interface (GUI) for compressive strength prediction of Glass powder concrete developed by **

I have made the GUI public for the usage and improvement of more similar problems and the sole purpose of research and development.

** Made by: Muhammad Saud Khan from Department of Civil Engineering, University of Manitoba, Canada, and Department of Civil Engineering, COMSATS University Islamabad and Department of Civil Engineering, and Ghulam Ishaq Khan Institute of Engineering Sciences and Technology.

Here are some tips how we have developed the GUI.

Python must be installed.
relevant libraries must be installed.
Run it in IDEs such as VS code, Jupyter notebook, Anaconda, Spyder, etc.
Load code*.
Make sure to change directory
Tips to run code.

Install all libraries
Make sure all files uploaded here are contained in relevant folder
Just run the code.
Using scroll adjust input values
Click on predict under model (click on relevant property to be predicted)
See output
Clear the values using clear button
Change values and repeat the process from 2 to 6
